# Machine-Learning-Projects

This repository is a collection of beginner-to-intermediate machine learning projects implemented as Jupyter Notebooks. Each folder contains a single project with the dataset used and a notebook that walks through data loading, exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

Projects included
---------------

- Diabetes Prediction Project
	- Notebook: `Diabetes Prediction Project/Diabetes prediction.ipynb`
	- Dataset: `Diabetes Prediction Project/diabetes.csv` (Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset)

- Heart Disease Prediction
	- Notebook: `Heart Disease Prediction/Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb`
	- Dataset: `Heart Disease Prediction/heart.csv`

- Loan Status Prediction
	- Notebook: `Loan Status Prediction/Loan Status Prediction.ipynb`
	- Dataset: `Loan Status Prediction/loan_dataset.csv`

- Rock and Mine Prediction
	- Notebook: `Rock and Mine Prediction/Rock vs Mine Prediction.ipynb`
	- Dataset: `Rock and Mine Prediction/sonar data.csv`

- Spam Mail Prediction
	- Notebook: `Span Mail Prediction/Spam mail prediction.ipynb`
	- Dataset: `Span Mail Prediction/mail_data.csv`

Getting started
---------------

1. Clone the repository:

	 git clone https://github.com/KarunyaGupta/Machine-Learning-projects.git

2. (Optional) Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

	 python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

3. Install dependencies:

	 pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the notebook you want to run using Jupyter Lab/Notebook or upload it to Google Colab. If running locally:

	 jupyter lab

Notes on running
----------------
- The notebooks were primarily developed in Google Colab and may contain paths like `/content/...`. When running locally, either update those paths or place the datasets in the notebook's working directory.
- Most notebooks use common libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and matplotlib. A minimal `requirements.txt` is included.

Repository structure
--------------------

Each project folder contains:

- A Jupyter notebook with step-by-step code and explanations.
- A CSV dataset used by the notebook.

Contributing
------------

Contributions are welcome. If you want to add a project or improve an existing notebook:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch for your changes.
3. Open a pull request describing your changes.
